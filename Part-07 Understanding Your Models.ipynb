    "# DESCRIPTION: \n",
    "For making a practical use of our models, we need to look beyond accuracy. We need to understand what the model gets right or wrong in order to improve it. We start with machine learning concepts such as confusion matrix, and metrics associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also look at using interactive visualization tools such as **t-SNE** for visualizing the text. We also discuss the idea of using custom embeddings such as sentence embeddings averaged from word embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is solely for the purpose of gaining insight into the model and its inputs. In order to this, we will learn some of the most popular tools such scikit-learn metrics for _confusion matrix, matplotlib and seaborn_ for visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we conclude with code explaining how to use the incredibly powerful **LIME** and **Shapley Additive Explanations** based techniques for NLP model interpretation. This is the only book to cover them in sufficient depth with hands on examples. They are modern bleeding edge tools, with shap still under active deployment. "
