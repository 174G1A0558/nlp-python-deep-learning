Natural Language Processing Notebooks
--
### Written for Practicing Engineers

This work builds on the outstanding work which exists on Natural Language Processing. These range from classics like Jurafsky's Speech and Language Processing to rather modern work in The Deep Learning Book by Longfellow et al.

While they are great as introductory textbooks for college students - this is intended for practitioners to quickly read, skim, select what is useful and then proceed. There are 10 notebooks divided into 7 logical themes.

Each section builds on ideas and code from previous notebooks, but you can fill in the gaps mentally and jump directly to what interests you.

- Just Getting Started? We learn better with code-first approaches. Checkout [Introduction To Text, with Text Classification](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-01.ipynb)

- Text is Messy. Checkout [Text Cleaning](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-02-A.ipynb) notebook (again, code-first approaches). [Spell Correction](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-02-B.ipynb) covers *almost everything* that you will ever need to get started with spell correction, similar words problems and so on. 

- Simple Classifiers and How to Optimize Them is a handy skill to have. We go further on how to combine and "ensemble" them for increased performance. Checkout [Modern Methods for Text Classification](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-05%20Modern%20Text%20Classification.ipynb)
