Natural Language Processing Notebooks
--
### Written for Practicing Engineers

This work builds on the outstanding work which exists on Natural Language Processing. These range from classics like Jurafsky's Speech and Language Processing to rather modern work in The Deep Learning Book by Longfellow et al.

While they are great as introductory textbooks for college students - this is intended for practitioners to quickly read, skim, select what is useful and then proceed. There are several notebooks divided into 7 logical themes.

Each section builds on ideas and code from previous notebooks, but you can fill in the gaps mentally and jump directly to what interests you.

## Chapter 01 
[Introduction To Text, with Text Classification](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-01.ipynb). Perfect for  Getting Started! We learn better with code-first approaches. 

## Chapter 02
[Text Cleaning](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-02-A.ipynb) notebook (again, code-first approaches). [Spell Correction](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-02-B.ipynb) covers *almost everything* that you will ever need to get started with spell correction, similar words problems and so on. 

## Chapter 04
[Text Representations](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-04%20Text%20Representations.ipynb). Converting text to numerical representations aka vectors. This covers lot of popular celebrities: word2vec, fasttext and doc2vec. 

## Chapter 05
[Modern Methods for Text Classification](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-05%20Modern%20Text%20Classification.ipynb). Simple Classifiers and How to Optimize Them. This is a handy skill to have. We go further on how to combine and "ensemble" them for increased performance. 

## Chapter 06
[Deep Learning for NLP](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning/blob/master/Part-06%20Deep%20Learning%20for%20NLP.ipynb), with Text Classification as an example. We use PyTorch and torchtext. This is a from scratch code tutorial, but I assume familiarity with Deep Learning. We write our own data loaders, pre-processing, training loop and other utilities.
